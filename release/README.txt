This directory contains all of the files related to the
project_release.module, which provides a "Project release" node type
so that projects can have releases. Each release has a version string,
a title, a body of text, and a file associated with it. Once this
module is enabled and releases are created, the pages to browse for
projects on your site will have download links, as will the project
nodes themselves. If the project_issue.module is installed, issues
will have a version string for any projects that have releases.

Send feature requests and bug reports to the issue tracking system for
the project module: http://drupal.org/node/add/project_issue/project,
and specify "Releases" as the component.

The project_release.module was originally written by Derek Wright
"dww" (http://drupal.org/user/46549) as part of the new system for
releasing Drupal contributions. For background, see:
